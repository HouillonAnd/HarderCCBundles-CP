Harder Community Center bundle mod for Stardew Valley

In the event that I have not been active on the chucklefish forums, Nexus Mods, or SDV public discord for at least 30 days, I give permission for any willing SDV modder to fork, modify and distribute code from this repository.

In the event a new SDV and/or SMAPI version is released that breaks compatibility of my mods, the inactivity duration only needs to be 7 days for the above permission to be valid.

I ask that should I return after such a time, that the person who was kind enough to take over maintenance of my mods return them to myself.

**Minerva's Harder Community Center Bundles** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod that overhauls the entire set of Community Center bundles, making it harder to complete, but giving better bundle rewards.
